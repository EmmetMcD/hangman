# hangman
Very badly put together hangman AI; trying to figure this out very clunkily, will optimize when I get a working version
I am aware I am probably approaching this from an extremely awkward angle; but sigmoids and more complex ai stuff scare me atm.
The general idea behind this is inspired by the MENACE machine learning thing, which was a pile of matchboxes
